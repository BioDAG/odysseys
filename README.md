Odysseus: Odysseus: a versatile high performance framework for optimizing bioinformatics workflow parallelization in hybrid cloud environments

Odysseus is a versatile high performance framework for component-based bioinformatics workflows that aims to optimize parallelization performance, resource allocation and load distribution across heterogeneous computational resources comprising of both cloud-based solutions as well as local HPC infrastructures and general resources. Odysseus attempts to set the core principles of cost efficient parallel processing for large scale bioinformatics workflows by introducing data preprocessing and organization techniques as well as achieving optimal parallelization and resource utilization both across and within the available computational resources.
