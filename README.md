Odysseus: a versatile high-performance framework for enabling bioinformatics workflows on
hybrid cloud environments
================

Odysseus is a high performance hybrid cloud framework for component based bioinformatics workflows that aims to optimize performance,
resource allocation and load distribution across heterogeneous computational resources, i.e. comprising of both cloud-based solutions
as well as local HPC infrastructures and general resources. Odysseus attempts to set the core principles for cost efficient parallel
processing of large scale bioinformatics workflows by introducing data preprocessing and organization techniques as well as optimal
load distribution both across and within the available computational resources.
